	`	The character you make is completely your own. Everything from their name, preferences, and identity is determined by your own imagination. However, in order to give you an interface with the universe, we do have some canonical backstories.`
	`	The first and easiest choice is the Trust Fund Baby. This character grew up on a wealthy planet and only moved to New Boston to get their pilot's license. They are currently waiting on their trust to pay up, but they won't have to wait long.`
	`	The second is the normal start for Endless Sky. The Textile worker who grew up on New Boston and has been dreaming of being a space pilot since childhood. They finally saved up enough for a down payment on a loan while studying for their pilot's license. Nothing special will happen to them unless they make it happen.`
	`	The final and most difficult is the Reformed Pirate. A former outlaw rehabilitated by the Republic and granted a merchant pilot's license, you barely qualify for a loan to purchase your new ship. However, you have made dangerous enemies in the past, and must be prepared to outrun them. You had better pick a fast ship!`

Finding ways to ignore enemy shields, overheat their vessels, or drain their batteries can prove even more effective than buying the biggest ship you can and slugging it out. Most secondary weapons, such as missiles, can help you out-range and outrun your enemy, too!`
	`	The main default keys you will use in combat are your arrow keys to move, (Tab) to fire your primary weapon, (W) to select your secondary weapon, and (Q) to fire your secondary weapon.`

Salaries vary based on the rank of the crewman, as do their shares. More expensive crewmen will be required with the more crew you have.`

	`	Your most common crewmen, the "Regulars," handle these jobs. They also cost the least. Drawing 100 credit salaries per day, and only taking one ship share each.`
	`	Some, more cruel, captains have been known to throw hoards of their regulars at hostile ships in boarding operations. This is seen as distasteful, and is absolutely an abuse of your workforce. However, thanks to the Syndicate's economic influence, the Republic has yet to pass any laws restricting or regulating this, and will not require you to provide hazard pay.`

	`	The Universal Credit System is managed by an alien species known as the Quarg. According to them, these same credits are accepted by every "Tier One or higher" civilization in the known universe. Although there was a lot of political resistance in the early days of the Human exploration, the UCS "Bank" has been accepted and used by every human government for centuries.`
	`	This means that you could theoretically hire crewmen on an alien planet, and they would automatically be paid just the same as their human counterparts.`
